# 8Puzzle
I implemented BFS, DFS, Bidirectional, and A* to solve 8Puzzle game with python. 
There is tow main part in this program : 
1)Puzzle engine: in this part, you can find how I implemented these algorithms' logic, by changing searchAlgorithm variable to "bfs", "ids", "bidirectional", "A_star" you can use these search algorithms.

2)puzzleMain: in this part, you can see how UI with py game is implemented.
